# javascript and classes

## OOP

## Object
- collection properties (const, var) and methods (function)
- toLowerCase

## why use  OOP
- OOP in JavaScript helps organize code, reuse it, and make it easier to maintain and scale.
- OOP helps to create complex objects from simple ones.

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new,this)

## 4 Pillars
 - Abstraction : Hides complex details, showing only what's necessary.
 - Encapsulation : Bundles data and methods, restricting direct access to some components.
 - Inheritance : Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another.
 - Polymorphism : Lets different objects be treated as instances of the same class, enabling flexibility.
